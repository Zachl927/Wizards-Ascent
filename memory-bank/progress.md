# Progress for tracking completed steps

## Step 1: Set Up Development Environment (Completed on 2025-03-13)

- Created the project directory structure:
  - `/client`: Frontend code using PixiJS
  - `/server`: Backend code using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io
  - `/shared`: Directory for shared resources between client and server
  - `/assets`: Game assets directory with subdirectories for sprites, backgrounds, audio, and effects

- Initialized Git repository for version control

- Set up package.json files for both client and server directories

- Installed required dependencies:
  - Client: pixi.js (v8.8.1)
  - Server: express (v4.21.2), socket.io (v4.8.1), mongoose (v8.12.1)

- Created basic initialization files:
  - Created server.js with Express server setup and Socket.io integration
  - Created client HTML and JavaScript files for PixiJS initialization

- All tests passed successfully:
  - Directory structure verified
  - Git repository properly initialized
  - Dependencies correctly installed in both client and server directories

## Step 2: Asset Preparation (Completed on 2025-03-13)

- Organized asset directory structure:
  - `/assets/sprites/player`: Player wizard sprites for idle, moving, and casting animations
  - `/assets/sprites/enemies`: Enemy sprites including slime, skeleton, and dark wizard
  - `/assets/effects/spells`: Spell effect visuals including fireball, ice spike, and lightning
  - `/assets/backgrounds/tiles`: Arena background tiles including floor, wall, and water
  - `/assets/backgrounds`: Arena tileset combining multiple tile types
  - `/assets/audio/sfx`: Sound effects for spell casting, hit, and defeat
  - `/assets/audio/music`: Background music for the game

- Created minimally viable pixel art assets in 8-bit retro style:
  - Player wizard sprite in three states: idle, moving, and casting
  - Three enemy types: slime, skeleton, and dark wizard
  - Three spell effects: fireball, ice spike, and lightning
  - A complete arena tileset with floor, wall, and water tiles
  - Placeholder sound effects and background music

- Implemented asset generation tool:
  - Created Node.js script using Canvas API to programmatically generate game assets
  - Ensured all assets maintain a consistent 8-bit pixel art style
  - Optimized assets for web performance with appropriate file sizes and formats

- All tests passed successfully:
  - Verified all required assets are present and properly organized
  - Confirmed sprites and images load correctly and match the game's visual style
