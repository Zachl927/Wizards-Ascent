# Progress for tracking completed steps

## Step 1: Set Up Development Environment (Completed on 2025-03-13)

- Created the project directory structure:
  - `/client`: Frontend code using PixiJS
  - `/server`: Backend code using Node.js, Express, and Socket.io
  - `/shared`: Directory for shared resources between client and server
  - `/assets`: Game assets directory with subdirectories for sprites, backgrounds, audio, and effects

- Initialized Git repository for version control

- Set up package.json files for both client and server directories

- Installed required dependencies:
  - Client: pixi.js (v8.8.1)
  - Server: express (v4.21.2), socket.io (v4.8.1), mongoose (v8.12.1)

- Created basic initialization files:
  - Created server.js with Express server setup and Socket.io integration
  - Created client HTML and JavaScript files for PixiJS initialization

- All tests passed successfully:
  - Directory structure verified
  - Git repository properly initialized
  - Dependencies correctly installed in both client and server directories

## Step 2: Asset Preparation (Completed on 2025-03-13)

- Organized asset directory structure:
  - `/assets/sprites/player`: Player wizard sprites for idle, moving, and casting animations
  - `/assets/sprites/enemies`: Enemy sprites including slime, skeleton, and dark wizard
  - `/assets/effects/spells`: Spell effect visuals including fireball, ice spike, and lightning
  - `/assets/backgrounds/tiles`: Arena background tiles including floor, wall, and water
  - `/assets/backgrounds`: Arena tileset combining multiple tile types
  - `/assets/audio/sfx`: Sound effects for spell casting, hit, and defeat
  - `/assets/audio/music`: Background music for the game

- Created minimally viable pixel art assets in 8-bit retro style:
  - Player wizard sprite in three states: idle, moving, and casting
  - Three enemy types: slime, skeleton, and dark wizard
  - Three spell effects: fireball, ice spike, and lightning
  - A complete arena tileset with floor, wall, and water tiles
  - Placeholder sound effects and background music

- Implemented asset generation tool:
  - Created Node.js script using Canvas API to programmatically generate game assets
  - Ensured all assets maintain a consistent 8-bit pixel art style
  - Optimized assets for web performance with appropriate file sizes and formats

- All tests passed successfully:
  - Verified all required assets are present and properly organized
  - Confirmed sprites and images load correctly and match the game's visual style

## Step 3: Implement Basic Frontend with PixiJS (Completed on 2025-03-13)

- Implemented a modular, object-oriented architecture for the game frontend:
  - Created `AssetLoader` class for handling game asset loading with fallback support
  - Implemented `InputHandler` class for managing keyboard inputs (WASD movement)
  - Developed `Player` class for player character state and rendering
  - Created `Game` class as the central coordinator for game initialization and loop

- Added player character with different visual states:
  - Implemented state switching between idle and moving animations
  - Added proper sprite scaling and centering

- Implemented WASD movement with the following features:
  - Responsive keyboard input handling
  - Normalized diagonal movement to maintain consistent speed
  - Canvas boundary detection to keep player within game bounds
  - Dynamic state changes based on movement

- Added performance optimizations:
  - Implemented efficient game loop using requestAnimationFrame
  - Added error handling for asset loading with visual fallbacks
  - Included debugging tools for collision boundary visualization

- Added user interface improvements:
  - Loading screen during asset initialization
  - Movement instructions for players
  - Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

- Fixed asset loading issues:
  - Updated asset paths from relative (`../assets/...`) to absolute (`/assets/...`) for reliable browser loading
  - Enhanced server configuration to properly serve static assets
  - Implemented fallback sprites for error resilience

- Enhanced Express server functionality:
  - Configured proper static file serving for both client files and game assets
  - Set up optimized routing for the main game entry point
  - Improved server logging for better debugging and monitoring

- All tests passed successfully:
  - Game launches correctly in browser
  - Player character appears in the center of the canvas
  - WASD keys move the player with appropriate animations
  - Player movement is bounded within the canvas
  - Character animations switch correctly between idle and moving states
  - All game assets load properly without 404 errors

## Step 4: Add Basic Spellcasting (Completed on 2025-03-13)

- Implemented projectile spellcasting with left mouse button:
  - Added `Spell` class to handle projectile physics, movement, and rendering
  - Enhanced `InputHandler` to track mouse position and click events
  - Implemented spell logic to travel in the direction of mouse cursor
  - Added distance limiting (500px) for spell projectiles

- Implemented spell visual effects:
  - Added sprite loading for spell effects
  - Applied rotation to align spell sprite with travel direction
  - Configured correct sprite scaling and positioning
  - Implemented smooth travel animation

- Added player spellcasting mechanics:
  - Integrated 'casting' animation state
  - Added cooldown system (500ms) between spell casts
  - Implemented simultaneous movement and casting
  - Set up state priority system (casting > moving > idle)

- Optimized performance:
  - Added efficient spell cleanup for projectiles that reach maximum distance
  - Implemented canvas context state management for sprite rotation
  - Added performance-friendly spell collection management

- Enhanced user interface:
  - Updated in-game instructions to include spellcasting controls
  - Provided visual feedback through player animation state changes
  - Maintained smooth gameplay during simultaneous actions

- All tests passed successfully:
  - Left-clicking creates a projectile at the player's position
  - Projectile travels toward the mouse cursor position
  - Spell correctly disappears after traveling 500 pixels
  - Player can move and cast spells simultaneously
  - Visual states transition properly during all actions
